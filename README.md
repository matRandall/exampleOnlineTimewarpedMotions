# Online Time Warped Motions
Examples of motions time warped using online time warping algorithms developed Mathew Randall at Birmingham City University.  During the this programme of research, each online time warping algorithm was applied to 3246 pairs of input and target motions.  A selection of the resulting aligned input motions, have been rendered into videos, along with the taregt motion, to visualise the accuracy and quality of the time warped alignment produced. 

# Videos

Each video contains a render of the target motion that the input motion was being aligned to on the right, along with aligned input motions resulting from the time warping algorithm.  

Different on-line time warping algorithms are demonstrated in each video.  The algorithm used to align a given motion is shown above the respective render.  The algorithm that produced the best alignment is always included in the video. 

Videos are located in the videos folder in this repository.  Each video is title based on the ID number given to the pair motions used in the alignment and the motion being performed.
